	<h1>Graphic Designer | Boston</h1><br>

Currently attending Massachusetts College of Art and Design, in my junior year. I am a truly dedicated, highly motivated designer. Although deisgn consumes most of my time, when my face is not mesmorized by a computer screen, my mind is absorbed in a book. I try to communicate other forms of fine art into my design as much as possible and love painting, photography, and printmaking. Televison, movies, and social media absord the other half of my free time. If you'd like to know more and/or have any questions, please send me an email at mlril3y@gmail.com
