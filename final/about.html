	<h2>Graphic Design | Illustraton | Photography</h2><br>

Hi, I'm Megan. I am currently attending Massachusetts College of Art and Design, in my junior year, heading towards a BFA in Graphic Deisgn. I like to think of myself as a dedicated, highly motivated designer and I try to communicate other forms of art into my design as much as possible, especially painting and photography. Although designing consumes most of my time, when my face is not mesmerized by a computer screen, it's usually absorbed by food and Netflix, my two great loves. Reading, social media and hanging out with real life people absorbs the remainder of my super exciting life. If you'd like to know more and/or have any questions at all, please send me an email at mlril3y@gmail.com.
