    <h2>Endangered Stamp Series</h2><br>
    This stamp series was part of a project for MassArt, created in my sophomore year. The animals depicted on these stamps are all endangered species. These stamps were created to show light on the fact that some of the animals that seem more common to humans are actually in trouble.
    <br><br>Usually one think of a rare bald eagle when they think about endangerment, but these stamp show the grizzly bear, timber wolf, key deer, and kit fox. The colors represent which animals appear more commonly at night, blue background, versus the ones seen more commonly in the daytime, orange background.
