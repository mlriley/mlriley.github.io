    <h2>Allure</h2><br>
    Allure was a completely hand made word created out of broken mirror shards. This was a difficult project to complete since the mirror bits were so sharp, but I am extremely pleased with the result. The concept behind this piece is based on how others perceive you versus how you perceive yourself. The most beautiful person on the outside could think they appear broken, or vice versa. Hot glued onto plexiglass. 37 x 14.
